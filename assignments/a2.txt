change a2 due date to Mar 6, so could include a question from L14 (symbolic execution)
a3 due date end of term

* Q1: could reuse a PMD question - nah, too much overhead

* fuzzing: Q2-Q5
* Q2: mutation-based fuzzing
* Q3: grammar-based fuzzing (ask questions like the ones I was thinking about for the midterm)
* Q4: property-based testing
* Q5: reducing inputs---do a reduction manually; put a case where the test case is actually context sensitive (e.g. operations that write to state); grammar reduction

>>> ddr = DeltaDebuggingReducer(MidtermRunner())
>>> ddr.reduce (">001>;:>7>7351:>>512249<5;687539<>4:=0;<28215:01:<")
'39639'
>>> ddr = DeltaDebuggingReducer(MidtermRunner(),log_test=True)
>>> ddr.reduce (">001>;:>7>7351:>>512249<5;687539<>4:=0;<28215:01:<")

* Q6: Symbolic execution

reducing: implement a 'move stuff around' reduction pass

why does the grammar fuzzer return a super long last number when creating expressions?

coverage-based
% actually the impl can jump two steps...
% assignment problem inspired by midterm Q2: can't jump 2 steps in mutation; implement a fix to this (randomly keep some non-adding mutations, do two mutations) (but actually it should be able to...)
