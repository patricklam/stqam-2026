Assignment
Assignment (software bugs)
(72 ) For each of the types of programming scenarios below9, write (or ﬁnd) a small C
or C++ program, add the required speciﬁcation against the error (only if CBMC doesn’t
already do it for you), and use CBMC to get a counterexample showing the error. Name
the type of software bug. Say whether each veriﬁcation run is complete (slide 25). Say
what the eﬀect of executing each buggy program would be.
1. The program writes into a local string (allocated on the stack) one character more
than expected.
2. The same for a string allocated on the heap (with malloc or new).
3. The program tries to read the memory pointed by a global, uninitialized pointer
variable.
4. A float variable is divided by a variable whose value is currently zero.
5. A 16-bit signed integer overﬂow.
6. A ﬂoat underﬂow10.
9For an overview of programming bugs, see also
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software bug, section “Common types of computer bugs”.
10One note: in the current version, CBMC ”forgets” to add the required assertion for
underﬂow when you give it --signed-overflow-check; add it yourselves manually.

(38 ) Integer overﬂow can happen in the well-known binary search
algorithm. See the blog post: http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/
2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html.
Use CBMC to get a counterexample showing that error.
You may be surprised at how little computation time is needed by the tool,
even if you use the general integer type, and nondeterministic initialization
of most variables, including the array contents.
If you are curious: the webpage
http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2013/benchmarks.php (see the ﬁrst
link on the page) has many real-world benchmarks for CBMC
