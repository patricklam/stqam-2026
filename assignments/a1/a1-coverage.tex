\section*{Question 1: Statement and Branch Coverage (15 points)}
In this question you will write Python test suites that ensure
statement and branch coverage.  Write test suites that ensure 100\%
statement and branch coverage on the {\tt estimate\_size function} in the
{\tt a1q1\_estimate\_size/} directory (easy) and {\tt count\_tests} in the {\tt a1q1\_count\_tests/}
directory (slightly harder). Add them to the {\tt estimate\_size\_test\_suite.py}
and {\tt count\_tests\_test\_suite.py} files respectively.

The suites must run with 0 failures and 0
errors.

We will rerun your test suites and count coverage ourselves,
but you'll find instructions in the test suite py files about how to
generate coverage reports so that you can know if you've achieved the goal yet or not.
