* 3 weeks practical testing content

_* L01: general course intro (needs update, brief mention of oracles)
** L02: exploratory testing, regression testing, unit tests, behaviour vs state, representation invariants, test doubles, mock objects, flaky tests
** L03: coverage (https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Coverage.html) -> likely to be short, but put lots of stuff in L06, including also perhaps static analysis/semgrep content
** L04: mutation analysis; what does graph coverage buy?
** L05: oracles (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6963470)
        metamorphic testing
        https://www.cse.ust.hk/~scc/publ/CS98-01-metamorphictesting.pdf
** L06:
        code review/documentation (done)
        PMD/static analysis
        chaos monkey (done)


       if time permits or if L05 finishes early: SpotBugs, SemGrep, CodeQL, Checker framework
       probably not: static analysis content/using tools (Infer?) (look back at 2019 offering)

* A1 is due on the day of L08, so could mention fuzzing as in L07, but in the event, I didn't.

- test generation / assertions 
- invariant inference: https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/DynamicInvariants.html

fuzzing book suggestion:

    Learn how grammars can be used to generate syntactically correct inputs. This makes test generation much more efficient, but you have to write (or mine) a grammar in the first place.

    Learn how to fuzz APIs and graphical user interfaces. Both of these are important domains for software test generation.

    Learn how to reduce failure-inducing inputs to a minimum automatically. This is a great time saver for debugging, especially in conjunction with automated testing.
