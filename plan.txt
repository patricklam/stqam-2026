* 3 weeks practical testing content (L01, L02, L03, L04)

_ L01: general course intro (needs update, brief mention of oracles)
* L02: exploratory testing, regression testing, unit tests, behaviour vs state, representation invariants, test doubles, mock objects, flaky tests
* L03: coverage (https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Coverage.html)
* L04: mutation analysis; what does graph coverage buy?
* L05: 
       oracles (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6963470)
       https://www.cse.ust.hk/~scc/publ/CS98-01-metamorphictesting.pdf
_ L06:
       metamorphic testing
       code review/documentation
       chaos monkey
       probably not: static analysis content/using tools (Infer?) (look back at 2019 offering)

* A1 is due on the day of L08, so could mention fuzzing

fuzzing book suggestion:



    Start with Introduction to Testing and Coverage to get the basic concepts. (You may know some of these already, but hey, you're a student, right?)

    Learn how simple fuzzers work from the chapter on Fuzzers. This already gives you tools that took down 30% of UNIX utilities in the 90s. What happens if you test some tool that has never been fuzzed before?

    Mutation-based fuzzing is pretty much the standard in fuzzing today: Take a set of seeds, and mutate them until we find a bug.

    Learn how grammars can be used to generate syntactically correct inputs. This makes test generation much more efficient, but you have to write (or mine) a grammar in the first place.

    Learn how to fuzz APIs and graphical user interfaces. Both of these are important domains for software test generation.

    Learn how to reduce failure-inducing inputs to a minimum automatically. This is a great time saver for debugging, especially in conjunction with automated testing.
