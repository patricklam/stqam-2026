* 3 weeks practical testing content (L01, L02, L03, L04)

_ L01: general course intro (needs update, brief mention of oracles)
_ L02: exploratory testing, unit tests, behaviour vs state, test doubles, mock objects, flaky tests
_ L03: coverage, oracles, fuzzing / property based testing, metamorphic testing
       oracles (https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/DynamicInvariants.html, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6963470)
_ L04: mutation analysis; what does graph coverage buy?
_ L05: code review/documentation
_ L06: chaos monkey, static analysis content/using tools (Infer?) (look back at 2019 offering)

* 3 weeks Dafny (1251: L13, L14, L15, L16, L17; add the OOPSLA paper)
* L07 Dafny application: Cedar (might be a bit short)
_ L08 Dafny
_ L09 More Dafny, including VC and lemmas
_ L10 Bubblesort in Dafny
_ L11 Dafny sequences and VCgen
_ L12 Bounded model checking
