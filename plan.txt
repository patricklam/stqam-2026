TODO:
collect more papers to present
maybe record L14 lecture
definitely record lecture about how to present a paper; content/post/20160608-good-talks.md

* 3 weeks practical testing content

_* L01: general course intro (needs update, brief mention of oracles)
** L02: exploratory testing, regression testing, unit tests, behaviour vs state, representation invariants, test doubles, mock objects, flaky tests
** L03: coverage (https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Coverage.html) -> likely to be short, but put lots of stuff in L06, including also perhaps static analysis/semgrep content
** L04: mutation analysis; what does graph coverage buy?
** L05: oracles (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6963470)
        metamorphic testing
        https://www.cse.ust.hk/~scc/publ/CS98-01-metamorphictesting.pdf
** L06:
        code review/documentation (done)
        PMD/static analysis
        chaos monkey (done)


       if time permits or if L05 finishes early: SpotBugs, SemGrep, CodeQL, Checker framework
       probably not: static analysis content/using tools (Infer?) (look back at 2019 offering)

* A1 is due on the day of L08, so could mention fuzzing as in L07, but in the event, I didn't.

3 weeks fuzzing

** L07 intro to fuzzing / address sanitizer -> 70 minutes
** L08 mutation-based fuzzing -> exactly 80 minutes
      but also add https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/GreyboxFuzzer.html

      https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2015/04/finding-bugs-in-sqlite-easy-way.html
      mentioned afl-cmin, afl-tmin
** L09 grammar-based fuzzing [with about 20 slides leftover]
      https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Grammars.html
      https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/GrammarFuzzer.html
** L10 configuration fuzzing
      https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/ConfigurationFuzzer.html

** L11 reducing failure-inducing inputs 
      https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Reducer.html

if time permits:

*_ L14 L07 from W25: symbolic execution (need for BMC/Dafny)

*_ L15 CBMC/CPROVER, bounded model checking for C, and loop unwinding; verifying Rust with Kani: proof harnesses, contracts, and unsafe Rust
